## Election-Audit Summary
In summary we can use the results to determine the outcome of any election, including pass/fail initiatives. It would also be possile to determine voter turnout for each county based on populaton for the county and votes cast for the county. This would give a better idea of which counties strongly participate in the voting process and the weaker counties that may need additional encouragement to participate. This script can easily accomodate any number of candidates and/or counties.
